# Email Application
More Java Practice for me.

## This application

* Generates an email with the following syntax: firstname.lastname@department.company.com
* Determines the department from user choice (Sales, Development, Accounting), if none, leave blank
* Generates a random String password
* Has set methods to change the password, set the mailbox capacity, and define an alternate email address
* Has get methods to display the name, email, and mailbox capacity
* Presents a secondary menu to make further profile changes
